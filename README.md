# Connect 4
Author: Ellen Vandewater <br>
This is for EECS 368 JavaScript Project. I have choosen to create the game of Connect 4 for my project.
For Project 2 of this class, I have extended this game to be played as connect4 or connect5. Connect5 is when players have to get 5 pieces in a row on the same sized board. Making things more difficult. I also updated some of the CSS to look nicer.
